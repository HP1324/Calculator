# Optimizations needed
- Optimize ```toMathExpression(String str)``` function so that It works best with all cases(e.g.,with negative numbers)
- There is no ``` . ``` button to add floating point numbers, that must be added.
- Add button to clear only one letter, ```AC``` button clears whole field
- Add validation so no ```+ - / * ``` can be written adjacently
- Add scroll effect, when ```TextField``` is changed programmatically, it does not scroll when value goes out of it
- Add these buttons : ``` 00  .  %  C```
- Handle Range exceptions effectively
